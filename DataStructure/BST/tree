- An abstract data type(ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure .

An ADT spcifies:
1) Data stored
2) Operation on the data
3) Error conditions associated with operations

Tree Structure
    Abstract data type

    Data stored
        as a tree structure

    Operations
        ordinary data structure operations just as linked lists
        Insert, Delete, Search
        special searching approaches for trees and networks 
        Traverse

Terminologies
    Root, Edge, Node, Parent, Child, Siblings, Leaves (Terminal Nodes), Internal Node, Descendant, Ancestor, Path, Depth(length of path), Height(maximum path length), Degree(num of siblings), size of tree(num of nodes), Full Tree, Complete Tree

Characteristics
    Num of edges = num of nodes -1
    Depth of root = 0
    Height of root = height of tree
    Max num of nodes at level i with degree d
    = d**i
    Max num of leaves with height h and degree d
    = d**h
    Max size of a tree with height h and degree d
    = 1+d+d**2+d**3+...+d**h = (d**(h+1) -1)/d-1
    Height of a complete tree with size s and degree d
    = ceiling of  log(d, s(d-1) + 1) - 1

Binary Search tree
    Binary tree
        Tree with degree 2
    Binary search tree
        Tree with degree 2
        Tree designed for a fast search of stored data
        So far, what we have studied the characteristics of stored data
        Now this is related to the operations
